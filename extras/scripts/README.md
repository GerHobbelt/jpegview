# Scripts

This directory contains any miscellaneous batch files, or other scripts used to make certain tasks easier (like building libraries)

You do _NOT_ need to rebuild libraries from scratch.  The pre-built libraries are already included in the src\ directories.

The build scripts are for the people who do _WANT_ to start from scratch, whether it's for security, validation, or updating to a new version.

NOTE: Re-built libraries do not match 1:1 with previous builds.  The compiler puts other information into the binaries so they won't ever match 100%
